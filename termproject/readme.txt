    GAME DESCRIPTIONS
------------------------------
1) Doodle is the dog theme version of Wordle, and you compete against the computer. Input a 3-4 letter word. The CPU will then guess a word. The first to guess the correct word will win.
   Current Issue: After submitting the word, the guessing logic doesn't work yet.
   Plans to Resolve: Take time and think about logic to make it work. It would be helpful to research some logic ideas.
2) Escape Room lets you explore the room. Solve the puzzle. Find the hint, the key, and escape the room.
3) You are going to be a pilot of a helicopter. Press ↑ → ↓ ← keys to control the helicopter and avoid the obstacles! Fly as long as you can and aim for a high score!
   Plans for version 2.0:
   a) Allow the highest score to be recorded.
   b) Some items will fall from the top to give extra points, other items will fall and lower the score if you get hit by them.
